    faqQue: `WordPress hosting vs. Web Hosting`,
    faqAns: `When we say “WordPress hosting” we refer to a web hosting service that supports WordPress specifically. WordPress is generally not hard to be accommodated and many regular hosts do it perfectly. All they need is to cover several basic requirements for compatibility with the software such as to run MySQL and PHP on their servers. The real differentiating factor between hosts focused on WordPress and other, regular ones is in their expertise and dedication to WordPress - those that claim to be WordPress hosts usually offer additional support and features specifically for WP. MadPopo offers managed WordPress service in all its plans, which includes automatic updates of the core and free plugins, convenience tools such as staging, WP-CLI, WordPress Starter and WordPress Migrator, and performance and security features on server level and application level via the MadPopo Optimizer plugin and MadPopo Security plugin.`,

    faqQue: `What Is WordPress Hosting?`,
    faqAns: `WordPress is a free, open source content management system that needs a hosting environment with MySQL database and PHP language in order to function and make your WordPress-powered website available in the net. When choosing your host you first need to make sure that it covers these basic technical requirements to accommodate the software and then consider additional WordPress-specific services that are included in the hosting plan to give you maximum convenience and peace of mind such as security features, performance boosters and other managed solutions.`,

Managed WP hosts like MadPopo will take care of the WordPress updates, keep track of vulnerabilities and offer WAF protection and other security services, and build solutions that specifically offer WordPress performance and security boosts.
