      faqQue: `I am confused between choosing Shopify and WooCommerce. Please advice?`,
      faqAns: `WooCommerce and Shopify are two of the most popular CMS in the ecommerce industry. Each has its pros and cons.`,
      faqAns2:`WooCommerce is an open-source ecommerce platform that could be customized to fit almost all business scenarios. In contrast, Shopify is a closed-source platform, but it does offer ready-to-go themes and plugins. In terms of pricing, WooCommerce is cheaper since it is free. Shopify offers solutions ranging from $9 to $299 per month and takes between 0.5 and 2% commission on your sales.`,
      faqAns3:`When it comes to scalability, users consider Shopify to be expensive. With WooCommerce, you are in full control of the server resources and pay only for the tools you use. On the other hand, with Shopify, your control over your store is somewhat limited, and you will have to pay a fixed amount regardless of your usage.
